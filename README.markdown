#XKnow

XKnow is a daily data logging tool for Android.  It can be
accessed on the Android Market.

#History

XKnow started life as EvenTrend, a project by Barclay Osborn.  With his
approval, the original Subversion repository at
http://code.google.com/p/eventrend/ was forked in September 2011 to its current
home on Github.

Because of key management problems, the continuing development could not
directly replace the original in the Android Market.  A new name was needed.  The new developers chose
XKnow because no projects at the time were using it and it can be interpreted as:

* Extended knowledge
* Know x (where x stands for anything one would like to know)
